# TestVector
This code will check each element on a numpy vector and see if its divisible by any number you want. And it'll do that only with slicing. 
(On the code i've put the number 3 and got random numbers on the vector just to exemplify).
There are other ways of doing that, with a loop you can have the same result but i wanted to do it on a more creative way.


NOTE: You can also use this code to check for other mathematical operations or other stuff, just use your creativity.
